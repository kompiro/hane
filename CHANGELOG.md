# Changelog

All notable changes to `hane` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this plugin adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) at the plugin level (see "Versioning policy" in README).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-05

Initial release. Eight skills extracted from [kompiro/karasu](https://github.com/kompiro/karasu) and decoupled from karasu-specific assumptions.

### Added

- `commit` — generate Conventional Commits messages from staged git changes.
- `ship` — push, open a PR, watch CI, run post-checks, and clean up.
- `start-dev` — Issue → worktree → plan → implement → commit → PR workflow.
- `design-doc` — create exploratory design documents under `docs/design/`.
- `acceptance-test` — create acceptance test records under `docs/acceptance/NNNN-*.md`.
- `qa` — generate a QA checklist from acceptance test records.
- `review-docs` — detect broken links and cross-document consistency issues.
- `sync-docs` — sync reference docs (README / spec / requirements) with the current implementation; reads target docs from host `CLAUDE.md`.
- Marketplace manifest with explicit HTTPS source so the plugin works for both public and private repos without SSH key setup.

### Conventions baked in

- Worktree path: `.claude/worktrees/<branch-name>` (coexists with Claude Code's Agent auto-worktrees — verified in [karasu#1116](https://github.com/kompiro/karasu/pull/1116)).
- All ADR promotion / `status:` label updates / `docs/{design,adr,acceptance}/` operations are gated on host-repo presence; absent conventions are skipped silently.
